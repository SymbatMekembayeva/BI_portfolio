Description:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data about serial killers across different countries and time periods. Unlike pre-existing datasets, all data in this project was collected manually — each case was individually researched, verified, and recorded into an Excel file with details such as the killer’s name, gender, nationality, active years, and number of victims.
